            <ion-label> <strong>What is the Steem?</strong> </ion-label>
            <p>
                Steem is a blockchain database that supports community building and social interaction
                with cryptocurrency rewards. Steem combines concepts from social media with lessons
                learned from building cryptocurrencies and their communities. An important key to
                inspiring participation in any community, currency or free market economy is a fair
                accounting system that consistently reflects each person's contribution. Steem is the first
                cryptocurrency that attempts to accurately and transparently reward an unbounded
                number of individuals who make subjective contributions to its community.

            <ion-label> <strong>What is the SteemConnect?</strong> </ion-label>
            <p>
                SteemConnect is an identity layer on top of the Steem blockchain that
                makes accounts secure, never have to give your keys out to anyone.
                <br>
                SteemConnect gives you full access to the Steem ecosystem without giving up your private keys.
                Thatâ€™s right, never risk a malicious or incompetent 3rd party app getting your private keys again.
                SteemConnect acts as the identity layer in between that enables participation without vulnerability.

            <ion-label> <strong> Security Measures! </strong> </ion-label>
            <p>
                Security is one of our main concern. We as users, we take security seriously. Even though SteemConnect
                encrypt your key in exchange of a token, we decide to also protect this token. For instance, storing
                the token in plan into the local storage, it can be retrieved by any other application. For iOS, the
                token is protected using the keychain which is highly secured. While for Android, the encryption is
                done by the following steps:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>A random 256-bit AES key is generated</li>
                <li>The AES key encrypts the value</li>
                <li>The AES key is encrypted with a device-generated RSA (RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding) from the Android KeyStore</li>
                <li>The combination of the encrypted AES key and value are stored in SharedPreferences.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                To retrieve the key, the process is inverted.
